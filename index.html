	<p class="journal">	Well, I think today is the closest chance we've ever have this season, but... David is such a suck goal keeper...Anyway, we've got 2:2, because of Mr.David's nice goal skill, he miss a ball that roll on the floor! Wow! Can you even imagine that a keeper even miss the floor on the ground? I have to say, nice skill! But.. he actually is a nice goal keeper, he almost save all of the ball that enemy shot, but that suck ball just go directly through his leg... I don't know what to said to that... Josaiah have two goals, he's really good! But it's OK even throught we got a tide, because I believe we can get them tommorow, come on team REDBULL! And another big event is that I slept two and half hours! You knwo what? I totally doesn't realized that! I pass out(yes that's true!)from 3:30 til 6:00! OMG! I swear I'll nerver sleep that long again.</p>
	<p class="journal-bigger"> Well, I think that's my big event about today, hope we can have a nice game tommorow!</p>

AGAIN, WE'RE LOST, AND IT'S NOT A MATCH ANYMORE, IT'S A BULLYING! 7:1! I don't think it's really nice to do this! They're such a bunch of guys that's really stupid!!!</p>
	<p class="journal">     Such a mess! Mom brought me to church morning. And... I believe I not that kind of guy that suppose to "believing jesus", see, I even forgot to put his name to capital letter!

	<p class="journal"> HeyHeyHey, don't blame me! I've told you guys, I just not that KIND OF GUY suppose to believe in Jesus. As you know, I made a mess! I block David's ball, and that freakin ball just roll into the hole, and Jermi just start to beat me up, I'm lucky, I can beat him, but he stole my cloth, and... after 1 minute, I've found it! It just stay right in the middle of the back door XD. I'm tired now, </p>
	<p class="red-font"> So I guess that is for today! Haha, new color! Isn't that cool?</p>
	<h1>10/19/2015</h1>
	<p class="journal"> Well, it's actually 10/20/2015 , I'm so sleepy yesterday XD. So, anyway, Kevin is here! And while he got here, I fall in sleep... woo..... and now he's in sleep XD. </p>
	<p class="red-font"> HAHA, now look at this guy!!!</p>
	<img src="http://i11.tietuku.com/6f0b9715d8354f45.jpg" width="25%">
	<p class="journal-bigger"> And that's the news, we'll see you tommorow at 8:15!</p>
	<h1>10/20/2015</h1>
	<p class="journal">Hey! What a busy day today! And Kyle now totally crazy, he invited about 8 or more people XD. And Kevin was at house and seep for whole day. And... I finished Flower for Algernon and I didn't like that ended, what a sad ended! Charlie lost all of the knowledge he've learned and he's started forgot everything that happenon his life. He started to hate life, but even though, he still try to read and write --- even he's started forget those.</p>
	<p class="journal">Let's shut down those negative words in journal, and today, as I said, it's super busy. I went to practice with those PCC guys. And I think it's not THAT hard to playing WITH them. And coach --- again --- is talking about how great we're at Saturday. It sounds like that we only had one game last week, but he just ignored the one game we lost really bad.</p>
	<p class="big-red-font">And that's the news, we'll see you tommorow at 8:15!</p>
	<h1 id="a1">10/21/2015</h1>
	<p class="journal">Ha! It seems like Kevin was sleepy, because this guy just freakin sleep for a whole day! And now he finally woke up and start to do somethings that good for his life. I don't think sleep is good for your life but It's good for your healthy. And also, I've learn some trick today:</p>
	<script type="text/javascript">
function confirmHappy()
{
var happiness=confirm("Hey dude it just a trick, are you sure to continuing?");
if (happiness==true)
  {
  alert("I said it's freakin a trick!");
  }
else
  {
  alert("Ha, isn't it cool?");
  }
}
</script>
<input type="button" onclick="confirmHappy()" value="This is my new trick!" />
<div class="more-info">
</div> 
<p class="journal-bigger">I know, it's totally amazing!</p>
<p class="journal">Anyway, I want to try if I can do a table of content at the top of the journal, that'll be helpful(even though it's empty XD.</p>
<p class="freakin-big">The First Update about Journal: Table of Content(At the top of the journal)</p>
<p class="journal">And now it looks more like a nice big website like those biggest company in the America. I don't really care about my journal is good or not, I just want to have a place where I can write some stuff and when I growing bigger I can come back and look at these stuff, which I spent half to a hour each day on. Anyway, my GPA is now drop freakin fast, I know I just need a few day to correct those, but... it doesn't look like mom gonna give me time. She just blame on me every time I got a bad great, I'm sad about that, I know... I know I just need about three days to correct those, I just need three days...</p>
<p class="journal">i don't know how many times I gonna said "anyway" in a day. But, anyway, I'm sleepy, and I guess is a great time to close for today.</p>
<p class="big-red-font">And that's the news, we'll see you tommorow at 8:15</p>
<h1>10/25/2015</h1> 
<p class="journal">I feel sorry about Kyle, I can't do what I've promise. Both Kevin and mom felt they didn't want to go to badminton. Well, even though they said they would like to played badminton, but when that times is coming, they just... er... lazy? I can't tell. And now I'm reading about Charlie's story:<Flower for Algernon></p>
<h1>10/27/2015</h1>
<p class="journal">Wow, I almost forget about the journal. Well, mom just finished spitting water to me. Because of my report is "way to simple". What the freak? The best things of my experiment is that this is EXTREMELY simple. When mom said that, she actually ignore where is the best part of my lab. So... I don't know how difficult is it to let water evaporation. But... she's still my mom. I can't change that. But, some of the opinion she made is not that great. She've told me, I can decide to listen her or not. Well, I don't really want to do stuff that oppsite of her opinion, but... I don't really know what to say about that. Because all she just did is to curse on me and then while she try it, she can't. And then she just going angry to everything. I... I don't know what to said.</p>
<p class="journal">Well, another big news is I try to start on my own game. But I don't think mom will support that. Even that's good for me. She's evaluation is base on her feeling. If she's happy, she will smile all day. But if she starting getting angry, she can just hit me because my "trash design". Do you know why I've playing lot of games before she realized? Because I don't get the chance to do anything. Maybe to day I'm done with my work, test, question everyday... But she can still find some stuff that'll get me in trouble. Like I didn't clean my backpack, I didn't bring back my P.E cloth... She just fucking have infinite reason that'll get me in trouble. </p>
<p class="big-red-font">Anyways, that's today's journal.</p>
<h1 title="wrote on 11/08/2015">11/08/2015</h1>
<p class="journal">Hey, sub dude, I've been giving up on journal for about 12 days. Wow, I didn't even realized that! Hey, on these past 15 days, my coding skill increase a lot. If you move the mouse on the Date information, you can see a little box pup out says it wrote on 11/08/2015. Just a small trick I've learn these day. Well, now I know how to use &ltpre&gt tag, O boy, you can't imagine how hard to type in "&ltpre&gt" in html5, it's freakin hard. Anyway, I'm listening "uptown funk", but my music software is crack, so I'm listening "Hall of Fame" that set up in my journal. I think it's pretty cool to having a journal with background music in it.</p>
<pre class="journal">	But the biggest things I can do in my journal is: I can make my paragraph finally!(Within &ltpre&gt tag) And I don't know why &ltpre&gt tag will automatic </br>changing the front, but I don't really care about that. But "You de bi you shi" which is a chinese means that Every since you want to get something, you </br>will lose another thing you have. I have to type &lt/br&gt every since I want to change another line. But I've got a great idea.</pre>
<p class="journal">Wee, it seems doesn't work! But to lazy to type. So I just gonna change it to default. I try to talk to mom that can let me publish this journal someday. (Maybe in github! That's a great place you can create your webpage), I think I'll just stop for today.<p>
<h1>12/17/2015</h1>
<p class="journal">I can't deny that I haven't wrote my journal for a long time. Well, it's true, but I'm really busy these day.</p>
